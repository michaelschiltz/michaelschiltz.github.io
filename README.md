## About myself

I am currently working for the Department of International History at the Graduate Institute, Geneva. My position entails more than research and teaching. For better of for worse, I happen to be the digital preservationist and curator for a unique collection of historical stock exchange quotes hosted there.
It used to be different. From 2011 to 2016, I was associate professor of financial history at the Institute for Advanced Studies on Asia, University of Tokyo. 
And, oh yes, I have also published stuff. In 2012, Harvard University Press published my “The Money Doctors From Japan: Finance, Imperialism, and the Building of the Yen Bloc, 1895-1937”. Even then, research has always been so much more. Apart from being a financial historian, I have been rather vocal in advocating OpenAccess, OpenSource, and a whole lot of other things with 'open' as a prefix. Nowadays, my interests include encryption and privacy, alternative methods for scientific publishing, strategies for enhancing the transparency and reproducibility of scientific results, and so forth...
Although my little son appears to try to make my hobbies impossible, I remain: free jazz addict, admirer of contemporary art, and amateur cook.
